**Objective**
Draft a work plan to create a small next.js web app that functions as an interactive dashboard.

**Details**
- Uses a simple UI (one page).
- Lets me choose up to three FRED series from dropdowns.
- Fetches the data using FRED API.
- Plots them over time with shaded NBER recessions.
- Has a text box where I can write a short note, and saves that note to the next chart.
- Allows me to export any chart as a .png file.
